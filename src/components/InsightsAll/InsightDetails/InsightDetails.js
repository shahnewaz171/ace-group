                                        <p>INSPIRED by true events, the first inspirational short series by ACE Pictures - a subsidiary of ACE Holdings Berhad – follows the story of mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Agilan Thani from Malaysia.</p>
                                        <p>The shorts – of the same name as the former ONE Welterweight World title challenger – tells the struggles of a bullied overweight young boy who turns into a fighter that goes by the moniker The Alligator, who plays himself in the ACE Group’s first inspirational short series.</p>
                                        <p>

                                        </p>
                                        <p>The series won the grand award in the web videos category of Television &amp; Corporate Media Awards 2021 at the 22nd World Media Festival in Hamburg, Germany – marking a historic win for ACE Group, said ACE Pictures president and director Peter Wong.</p>
                                        <p>The World Media Festival honours and celebrates excellence in television, corporate film, online and print productions on an international scale. This year, the festival received 811 entries from 41 nations.</p>
                                        <p>“The inspiration behind the short film represents ACE Group as a whole and what we stand for as a company,” said Wong.</p>
                                        <p>“Our philosophy is about helping talents who are passionate, disciplined, and able to persevere in their desire to achieve their full potential, which is what this story hopes to tell.”</p>
                                        <p>The award-winning video is one out of three cinematic short stories that was produced as part of ACE Group’s corporate branding.</p>

                                        <p>While corporate videos tend to be represented in a more rigid and neutral structure in terms of cinematics and narration, ACE Pictures sought to inspire by using storytelling as a key element.</p>
                                        <p>Featuring an eclectic TV commercial crew, a complete in-house post-production team and music by local musicians, the three shorts took 12 days to shoot.</p>
                                        <p>Meanwhile, the other two videos showcase the story of GT race car driver Zen Low and drone-racer Amir Haziq.</p>
                                        <p>While the former is presently in post-production, the latter has just been released and can now be viewed on [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_9PQGjU2ftfHh49jd2lzZg">ACE Group’s official YouTube channel</a>].</p>

                                            “We hope these videos will inspire everyone to believe in themselves and that amazing stories and transformations like these do indeed exist in real life, and not just in movies.
                                        </p>

                                            “All you need is some confidence, and the right support – be it a coach, a teacher, your family or friends,” said ACE Pictures chief executive officer Johnny Chang.

                                            ACE Pictures also shared that these three videos are merely a warmup as the company rides out the pandemic.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            With various projects in the pipeline, the team at ACE Pictures is more than ready to dive straight back into their main business: international film productions.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            It is also keen on going full steam ahead with bringing productions not just from the United States but Hong Kong, South Korea and more back into home ground – once the pandemic situation stabilises – to further boost Malaysian filming industry.
